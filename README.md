# bw_save_game: BioWare save game tools

This pure-Python library can read and write _Dragon Age: The Veilguard_ save files (`*.csav`).
It also comes with several tools (`csav2json`, `json2csav`) that can convert the save games to and from easily editable `.json` documents.

## Installation

Make sure you have these programs installed:

* Python 3.8 or newer

This package is available for download from [PyPI][1]. You can install it using `pip`:
```bash
pip install --upgrade bw_save_game
```

## Usage

For non-programmers this project ships two applications that can convert a save game into a human-readable JSON document and vice-versa.
Editing this document allows you to change every part of a save, however, ensuring correctness and consistency is up to you.

The following command converts `0-439591 Saria-Save 9 #874.csav` to JSON:
```bash
csav2json "0-439591 Saria-Save 9 #874.csav" my_wip_save.json
```
Converting the edited save file `my_wip_save.json` back to the game's binary save game format is as easy as running:
```bash
json2csav my_wip_save.json "0-439591 Saria-Save 9 #874-NEW.csav"
```
